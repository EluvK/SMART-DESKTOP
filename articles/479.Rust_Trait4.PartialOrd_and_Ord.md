### PartialOrd && Ord trait
#### PartialOrd
* `PartialOrd` 
``` Rust
enum Ordering {
    Less,
    Equal,
    Greater,
}

trait PartialOrd<Rhs = Self>: PartialEq<Rhs> 
where
    Rhs: ?Sized, 
{
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Rhs) -> Option<Ordering>;

    // provided default impls
    fn lt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;
    fn le(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;
    fn gt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;
    fn ge(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;
}
```
* `PartialOrd` is a subtrait of `PartialEq` and their impls **must always agree with each other**.
* The `lt`, `le`, `gt`, and `ge` methods of this trait can be called using the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` operators, respectively.
* All `PartialOrd` impls must ensure that comparisons are **transitive** and **duality**. That means for all a, b, and c:
    * **transitive**: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
    * **duality**: `a < b` if and only if `b > a`.
    > noted that the original blog use older version `asymmetry`, which was delete in rust-lang this [PR: pull/85637](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85637)
    > and here qoute the [reason](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85637/files/1cfc1874b526fd8a681ebfaf64c554077586c8b1) :
    >> /// - asymmetry: if `a < b` then `!(a > b)`, as well as `a > b` implying `!(a < b)`;
    >> * It is redundant: it already follows from a < b being defined as `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(Less)`, which implies `!(a > b)` (defined as `partial_cmp(a, b) != Some(Greater)`).
    >> * "asymmetry" is the wrong term, an "asymmetric" relation is a relation that satisfies "if `a < b` then `!(b < a)`".

    > asymmtery (in the correct sense of the word) is a consequence of duality, so we could state it in the corollary section if you wish. antisymmetry is more closely related to what the docs are currently stating, but it is defined for `<=`-style relations: `R` is antisymmetric if `R(a, b) && R(b, a)` implies `a == b`.

> 离散数学没学好，还是对`symmetric`,`asymmetric`,`antisymmetric`没弄懂。

* impl a `PartiaOrd` manually:
``` Rust
use std::cmp::{self, Ordering};

#[derive(PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl PartialOrd for Point {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Point) -> Option<cmp::Ordering> {
        if self.x > other.x {
            Some(Ordering::Less)
        } else {
            Some(Ordering::Greater)
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let t1: Point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    let t2: Point = Point { x: 2, y: 1 };

    assert!(!t1.lt(&t2));
    assert!(!t1.le(&t2));
    assert!(t1.ge(&t2));
    assert!(t1.gt(&t2));
}
```
* If all the members of a type impl `PartialOrd` then it can be derived:
``` Rust
// generates PartialOrd impl which orders
// Points based on x member first and
// y member second because that's the order
// they appear in the source code
#[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

#### Ord
* `Ord` is a subtrait of `Eq` and `PartialOrd<Self>`:
``` Rust
trait Ord: Eq + PartialOrd<Self> {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;

    // provided default impls
    fn max(self, other: Self) -> Self;
    fn min(self, other: Self) -> Self;
    fn clamp(self, min: Self, max: Self) -> Self;
}
```
* use `#[derive(...)]` if members of a type impl that trait.
``` Rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```
* impl a `Ord` manually:
``` Rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Ord for Point {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        match self.x.cmp(&other.x) {
            Ordering::Equal => self.y.cmp(&other.y),
            ordering => ordering,
        }
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for Point {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

impl PartialEq for Point {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.cmp(other) == Ordering::Equal
    }
}

impl Eq for Point {}

fn main() {
    let t1: Point = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

    let t2: Point = Point { x: 2, y: 1 };

    assert!(t1.lt(&t2));
    assert!(t1.max(t2) == Point { x: 2, y: 1 });
}
```
* 需要注意的就是，要么都用derive宏的写法，要么都手动实现

    > Implementations of [`PartialEq`], `PartialOrd`, and [`Ord`] **must** agree with each other. It's easy to accidentally make them disagree by deriving some of the traits and manually implementing others.

#### Noted
* `subtrait` 和 面向对象语言里的继承，思维方式是不一致的。上面这个手动实现`Ord trait`的代码，就没法用继承的逻辑来看。
    * `Ord : Eq + PartialOrd<Self>` : 理解为`Ord` **refine**(完善了) `Eq` + `PartialOrd`
    * 但是一旦写完了`imp Ord for Point`，虽然还没有`PartialOrd/Eq/PartialEq`，但是剩下的trait可以用`Ord`的methods来判断了...
    * 强行用继承的思维去理解就是~~父类方法的实现调用了子类方法~~？？？ 所以不能这么想...
